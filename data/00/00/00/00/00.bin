The Masterpiece of Fear

Layers of Fear: Legacy is a psychological and 
psychedelic horror game about a madness-engulfed 
painter striving to create his Magnum Opus. Learn the 
dark story of his past while gathering carefully
crafted personal items that can be found in the game. 

Traverse the vision-induced, constantly changing 
house full of supernatural phenomena, where each move
of the camera can shift the environment, and discover
the true motive of the artist.
